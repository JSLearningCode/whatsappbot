This project holds the code for some diferent whatsapp bots using the Selenium library.

## How to use

First you need to visit the selenium-webdriver npm package page [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver), and download the driver for firefox (or if you want to use another browser, you just need to change the driver object in the code). Be sure to add the driver place to your system PATH.

Then install the required packages with:

`npm install`

The code from the desired bot can be run with:

`node <botfile>`

Happy boting!!!
